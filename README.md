# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Project#
In this project, Python is used to explore data related to **bike share systems** for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, (New York City, and Washington.) 

in this project i wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
